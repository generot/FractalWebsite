# FractalWebsite

The fractal website has been developed by Martin Nakov, Emil Doychinov and Venelin Novakov.

The site is in the Bulgarian language as it has been made as a school project, so for the
time being, it will remain so, but it's not out of the question that we might add English 
language support in the future.
